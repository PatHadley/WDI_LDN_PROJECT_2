# WDI LDN PROJECT 2
##Rails project: _GreenDigits_ gardening app

Built by Pat Hadley as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course. London, Spring 2016.

###The concept

A social user-to-user app to help users get their houseplants cared for while on holiday and keep track of the plants they own.

As a learning project, this was a chance to build a full-stack Ruby on Rails app with a user model and various gems. Just don't take the concept too seriously...

###The pitch
![Welcome to GreenDigits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatHadley/scratchpad/master/greendigits-welcome-screenshot.png)

_GreenDigits_ is a friendly way to prevent houseplant death! One holiday at a time.

_GreenDigits_ attempted to tackle three causes of houseplant death.

* owners go on holiday - plants get no care :white_check_mark:
* owners don't know how to care for the particular varieties they own :x:
* owners forget to care for them because of busy lives :x:

The first of these was acheived using user-to-user email as the messaging tool.
The second was partly acheived with the use of a third party houseplant dataset.
The third - implementing calendar functions - was not acheived during the project build.


###Technology
Ruby Gems used:

* ransack
* ratyrate
* sass-rails
* jquery-rails
* turbolinks

CSS Framework:

* bootstrap
